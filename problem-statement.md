First assignment, preliminary due date: Friday 13 April (any time) - if you turn in your report by this date then I will comment on your report before you need to turn in the final version. 

The data sets are in the R datasets package. 

For problem 1, use the dataset LifeCycleSavings 
For problem 2, use the dataset PlantGrowth 

As usual, read the help for the dataset. 

For either problem, carry out an exploratory analysis and use an appropriate modeling technique for the data (multiple regression for problem 1, anova for problem 2). 

For problem 1, explore different models and choose a final model. Make sure to justify your final choice. 

For problem 2, determine whether there are significant differences between means of the groups and if so, which groups are different from each other. 

Your report should give a short background/introduction to the problem, a description of the modeling approach and appropriate output and commentary, along with your conclusions. Please do not include R code in your report, and any output that you do include should be 'pretty'; in particular, see the xtable gallery in R. 

This assignment is meant to be a SHORT report: 5 pages MAX should be plenty, and fewer will probably suffice. You will need to arrange with your opposite problem pair about commenting on each other's reports so that you can address any comments before handing your report in to me. 

To turn in your report, please email me a pdf version with both partners' names; e.g. if the names are Partner1 and Partner2, then the file name should be 
Partner1-Partner2.pdf
Make sure that both names are also included in the report, and that each page is numbered. 

Please don't hesitate to ask if you have any problems or questions.
